Formal proofs 
=============

Formal proofs of some elementary mathematical statements for (self-)educational purposes.
Currently in Agda but I may add some Coq and Lean proofs in the future.

What we have now:

* arithmetic:
  - `nat.agda`: natural numbers with addition, multiplication, ordering and properties of these
  - `div.agda`: division, modulo and divisibility of naturals
  - `gcd.agda`: greatest common divisor and Euclid's algorithm
  - `wf.agda`: well-founded induction for naturals

Planned:

* enumerative combinatorics:
  - cardinality of finite sets
  - bit vectors, combinations, permutations, ordered subsets, binary trees
  - explicit bijections between these
